// HOW TO MEASURE HOW TIME EFFICIENT A PIECE OF CODE IS?

// It's not a very nice way to measure the efficiency because the execution time will be different for different:

// Devices
// Programming Languages
// Set of Inputs

// time complexity is a measure of how the running time of an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases

// Example:-
// finding sum of N natural numbers we can use loop and formula...
// loop depends on N n^1=O(n)
// formula will run once n^0=O(1)

// n^0=O(1)

Algorithm	A set of step-by-step instructions to solve a specific problem.
Data Structure	A way of organizing data so it can be used efficiently. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, and binary trees.
Time Complexity	A measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on.
Space Complexity	A measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses, depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on.
Big O Notation	A mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. Used in this tutorial to describe the time complexity of an algorithm.
Recursion	A programming technique where a function calls itself.
Divide and Conquer	A method of solving complex problems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, solving the sub-problems, and combining the solutions. Recursion is often used when using this method in an algorithm.
Brute Force	A simple and straight forward way an algorithm can work by simply trying all possible solutions and then choosing the best one.

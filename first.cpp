// HOW TO MEASURE HOW TIME EFFICIENT A PIECE OF CODE IS?

// it's not a very nice way to measure the efficiency because the execution time will be different for different:

// Devices
// Programming Languages
// Set of Inputs

// time complexity is a measure of how the running time of an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases
